# Number-Guessing-Game
Number Guessing Game that was made through batch file programming.

Today I felt like uploading something new and different so that is why today I uploaded this.

This type of programming is called batch file programming.

IMPORTANT NOTICE:

This is a BETA, please use at your own risk.

Updates:

I am going to start publishing both batchfile and python code.

I am also going to start using Bitbucket so that I can publish my code in more places.

Please consider following me if you are interesting in the code that I publish.
